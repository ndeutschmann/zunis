    How to use a config file <tutorial/config>
    How to train without integrating <tutorial/nointeg>
    How to train on a pre-evaluated sample <tutorial/preeval>
    How to sample from a trained model <tutorial/sample>
    How to integrate in R^d <tutorial/Rd>


This section gives several examples for how to perform common tasks regarding training models,
saving the state of models and integrating within the API of this library. Due to the
high level of abstraction of the ZÃ¼NIS library, most tasks can be performed in only
few lines of code.

This tutorial conatians the following sections:
